CHANGES IN NEW VERSION
----------------------

* added Gateway configuration files
* some fixes and extensions in the auctioneer agent; the protocol for interaction with your bidder agents is unchanged
* added message to StartAuction class to distinguish different auctioneer agents
* added three actions to auctioneer for re-configuration and starting auctions; you are not supposed to use those actions
* added two parameters to auctioneer bean, for setting start auction message and action token


WHAT TO OBSERVE FOR FINAL COMPETITION
-------------------------------------

* due to a recently discovered bug, the initial StartAuction message can be delivered more than once; your code has to be able to handle this, e.g. by ignoring all but the first StartAuction message

* the auctioneer agent will be started by us and connect with your bidder agents via a gateway server; during the competition, DO NOT start your own auctioneer agent in the gateway group
* for connecting to the auctioneer agent, change the "parent" of your bidder agent node to "AotGatewayNode"
* our auctioneer agent will provide a special message, "aot2018auction", in the StartAuction message; you can check this message to make sure you are talking to the right auctioneer, and not an auctioneer started by mistake by one of the other groups
